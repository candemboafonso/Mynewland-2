  <h2>Angola Life</h2>
  Luanda has a warm equable climate. The surrounding region fronts a tropical coastal plain
  that gives way to a tableland dissected and drained by the Cuanza River and other coastal
  streams. Cambambe Dam, 110 miles (177 km) to the southeast on the Cuanza, supplies power
  to Luanda. Skyscrapers and wide avenues give Luanda a modern appearance. The higher par
  of the city, consisting of the outlying districts, is generally poverty-ridden, and the lower is
  commercial and industrial. The city is the seat of a Roman Catholic archdiocese and is home to
  Agostinho Neto University (1963) and the Catholic University of Angola (1997). The National
  Library of Angola and the National Historic Archive are also located there, as are several museums.
  <h1>Portugues Population in Angola</h1>
  Most of Luanda’s sizable Portuguese population left the city before Angola was granted
  independence from Portugal in 1975. The city’s population swelled dramatically during
  Angola’s civil war (1975–2002)—especially after 1992—as refugees fled from warfare in rural
  areas. Luanda has historically had difficulties with maintaining a clean and accessible water
  supply, and decades of war and insecurity exacerbated the situation. The influx of new
  residents completely overwhelmed the capacity of the city’s public services, such as sewage
  treatment and trash collection. Even in the years following the civil war, Luanda was still
  treatment and trash collection. Even in the years following the civil war, Luanda was still
  potable water.
